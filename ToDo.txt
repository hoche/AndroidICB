* Figure out how to do text selecting within the edittext.
     See https://guides.codepath.com/android/Working-with-the-TextView#inserting-html-formatting

* Handle other packets - Beep/Ping/Pong
* We set 
                mSocket.setKeepAlive(true);
                mSocket.setSoTimeout(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
  Make sure that we don't get reaped accidently by the AndroidOS even though the socket is still connected.
