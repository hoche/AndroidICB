* The message list is a ListView of TextViews. 
  Figure out how to do text selecting within the TextView.
     See https://guides.codepath.com/android/Working-with-the-TextView#inserting-html-formatting
     https://gist.github.com/nesquena/f2504c642c5de47b371278ee61c75124#file-readme-md
  Note: the main part of this is done, but need to figure out
  how to just select the submatch part, and then create a "send private
  message" sort of thing.

* Handle other packets - Beep/Ping/Pong

* We set 
                mSocket.setKeepAlive(true);
                mSocket.setSoTimeout(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
  Make sure that we don't get reaped accidently by the AndroidOS even though
  the socket is still connected.

* Fix the keyboard for the text entry to have a "Send" button.
  Not sure why this isn't working.

* BUG: the LogUtils/PathUtils expects a context to figure out where to
write files. Can't use a context in a static object. This causes the logging
to crash.
